## Assignment Setup

Before attempting to complete the assignment you must first [clone this repository](#cloning-the-repo) to your personal account in your preferred Version Control System (VCS). GitHub is the easiest to use for these assignments but it is possible to use another VCS.

You will find detailed instructions for your assignment in its dedicated README.md file.

### Setting up the Repo

1. Clone the assignment repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optima-partners/engineering-recruitment-assignments.git
```

2. Create a repository in your personal VCS account. Copy the URL of the repo you just created.
*Note*: This repo must be publicly accessible. 

3. Add the repo you just created to the cloned repository as a remote.

```bash
git remote add submission <your_repo_url>
```

## Completing the Assignment

### Assignment Requirements

There are two levels of requirements for each assignment:

- **Core Requirements**: These are the minimum requirements that must be met for the assignment to be considered as complete. All candidates should attempt these requirements.
- **Stretch Requirements**: These are optional requirements that can be met to demonstrate a higher level of understanding of the assignment. 
  - Candidates for the Core Engineer role are encouraged to attempt these requirements but it is not mandatory. 
  - Candidates for the Senior Engineer role are expected to attempt these requirements.

### Pushing your code to the submission repo

1. Commit and push your code to the submission repo. *Note*: You must push your code to the `main` branch.

```bash
git push -u submission main
```

## Submissions

### Submitting the Assignment

To submit your assignment you must push your source code into a repo in your personal VCS account. For your assignment to be considered as submitted, you must inform Optima Partners by emailing engineeringrecruitment@optimapartners.co.uk with a link to your repo.

You should add the following information to the solution README.md file in the `solution` directory:

- A description of the solution you have provided
- A list of requirements that you have met
- Any supporting documentation that you have provided

### Marking of submissions

Your submission will be marked against the requirements that the solution README.md file says have been met. Any supporting documentation that is provided will also be taken into account.
